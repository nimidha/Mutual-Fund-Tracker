What Is a Virtual Environment?

A virtual environment is like a clean container where you install only the Python packages your project needs. It avoids conflicts with other projects.


REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of rules that define how web services should communicate. A REST API allows clients (like your frontend) to send requests to a server and get data back in a standard format (usually JSON).

Why use a REST API?

    Separates backend logic from frontend

    Makes data accessible via URLs (/api/data)

    Useful for frontend apps, mobile apps, or third-party services

1. hashing password
